# Sign Up Form
## Skills used
Javascript, HTML, CSS
## Summary 
A generic multi-step sign up form that takes various inputs and progresses you through multiple stages before "creating your account". This project was created with the intention to build a nice user interface and also practice the logic needed to make such forms that we interact with online on a regular basis. There are several UI features that make the form come together, such as the phone number formatting itself as you type, and the requirement for your passwords to match before being able to continue through the form.
